/* 
Undefined is like a place holder wicch is like a place holder
in the memory.
Before executing a single line of code java scrippt alocate 
memory to all the variable and function.

JavaScript is a loosely  type language  - it doest not attaches any 
variables to its specific data type.we have put numbers to it letter we can 
also put string to it , letter we can also put boolean to it ,
so javaScript is very flexible in this case


we can not assign undefined to any varibale.
